# We are going to collaborate with the computer to discover insights buried in complex nested data structures 
# Complex nested data structures are things like Arrays, Arrays of Arrays or Hashes of Arrays of Hashes 

# There is a difference between raw data and conclusions drawn from data 
# When processed correctly, data can teach us many things 
# The conslusions we extract from data with programming are called insights 

# NDS into Insight 
#   Raw data in the from of an NDS
#       Provided from our databases, or 
#       Provided by a third party 
# Form hypotheses and write code to provide results from the NDS 
# Discover insights 

# Insights help us decide where to (or not to) build a warehouse, evaluate whether an investment is likely to be 
# positive or negative, build alternative major-league baseball staffing strategies, or even the cause of 1854 outbreak 

# Our effors will be divided into two phases 
# 1. learn to build and evaluate complex NDS so that we can work with them 
# 2. Identify a process for writing programs that process NDS into insights

# Nested data structures are tools for representing complex information in a way that humans can read and 
# that computers can process. Reading them and processing them allows us to create insights that improve our lives 

# To start we'll introduce some of the simplest nested data structures 
# Arrays of Arrays (AoA)
# Arrays of Hashes (AoH)
# Hashes of Arrays (HoA)
# Hashes of Hashes (HoH)
